`qwebdriver` is a partial implementation of a webdriver using `PySide2.QWebEngine`.

It supports script execution and screenshot taking.

For technical reasons related to the Qt event loop, a python interpretor should use `iwebdriver`.

It is possible to start an interactive driver with `python -m qwebdriver.iwebdriver` (use `--help` for more options).
